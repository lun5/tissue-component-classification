Attached please find the list of latest objects with basic properties
in file ending with _adjDela, also new object map in_circle_map and
new clustered colors in _k3.


In _adjDela, each line has objectID, objectArea, objectType(1 for
nuclei, 2 for stroma, 3 for lumen), objectXCoord,
objectYCoord,numberOfNeighbors,objectIDs of neighbors. first line of
_adjDela is the number of objects


Example line:

1,797,2,16.0,74.0,3,98,186,185

ObjectID 1
ObjectArea 797 pixels
ObjectTYpe stroma
XCoordinate 16
YCoordinate 74
Has 3 neighbors with IDs 98, 186, and 185

X and Y coordinates may flip in Matlab environment, you should better
visualize to confirm.
